Instructions:

Open the attached PNG. I want you to create this page using the html provided. 

You are not allowed to alter the html file, only use CSS and place the css you create 
in css/styles.css (provided).

Some of the tags have been given classes with specific names to give you a hint. Do not add any classes or IDS to the html either. 

Use the existing html file and do not alter it in any way.

After you have created this page, I want you to add the following javascript functionality:

When the user clicks the Disney anchor link, stop the browser from opening a seperate window and
instead make all the paragraph headers change to red using vanilla javascript. (No libraries. Just javascript.)

At the same time change the text of the first paragraph to say "Lorem Ispum Rocks".

Then create a script using javascript that counts how many times you click on each paragraph, 
and if the user hovers over the header or footer show the number of times in the browser console.
 If you can, try to make an object oriented or object literal solution that can be initialized.

 You will score extra points for if you can do it that way. Again, no libraries. Just plain vanilla javascript.

Good luck. Hope to hear from you soon.
